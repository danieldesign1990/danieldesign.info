            Property Finder is&nbsp;an&nbsp;online service that includes a&nbsp;website and application and lists commercial and residential properties for sale and rent. The company makes money by&nbsp;charging for placing listings and connecting real estate agencies with potential buyers for new developments. It&nbsp;also earns commissions as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mortgage broker by&nbsp;introducing clients to&nbsp;banks.

        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Additionally, besides the advertisements, the site contains analytical information about the UAE market from the Dubai Land Department (DLD); specifically, it&nbsp;can help understand whether it&nbsp;is&nbsp;more profitable to&nbsp;buy an&nbsp;apartment with mortgage or&nbsp;to&nbsp;rent and save or&nbsp;which property is&nbsp;better as&nbsp;an&nbsp;investment; helps to&nbsp;assess the best places to&nbsp;live if&nbsp;you relocate with young children; explains how local laws work and how they can protect you; and many other useful things&mdash;making it&nbsp;a&nbsp;comprehensive service related to&nbsp;property selection and transaction processing.

            The service value for individuals is&nbsp;that they can find housing that suits their needs and budget, and the real estate agent communicating with them will provide professional assistance, honestly disclose all terms, and quickly prepare the necessary documents.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Individuals have different needs. For instance, an&nbsp;investor wants to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;complete catalog of&nbsp;all new developments to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;reliable property with minimal risk and maximum return. A&nbsp;relocating person with a&nbsp;family wants to&nbsp;find economically affordable housing in&nbsp;the community that is&nbsp;better in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;location to&nbsp;school and commute to&nbsp;work. Both should see honest and accurate information, including photos and prices, and the agents responding to&nbsp;their queries should provide quick and high-quality service, consult, disclose all conditions, and draft transparent contracts.

        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The service value for real estate agencies (brokerages) is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;provides a&nbsp;steady source of&nbsp;interested potential clients from which their transactions, commissions, and earnings are generated.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Brokerages should receive quality leads from the company, meaning potential clients who are actively interested in&nbsp;the property from the listings, that can be&nbsp;quickly and efficiently turned into profitable deals that benefit both sides. They should understand how to&nbsp;maximize the use of&nbsp;the service, see transparent results on&nbsp;their return on&nbsp;investment, and have the ability to&nbsp;find insights within their company and in&nbsp;the real estate market to&nbsp;make management decisions and choose effective development strategies.

        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The service value for developers is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;allows them to&nbsp;manage partner sales and stimulate demand when needed, that&nbsp;is, to&nbsp;sell properties as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible through partners they have contracts with and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;set budget level.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Developers need sales stimulation at&nbsp;the right times and for the right budget. They want to&nbsp;sell all their projects as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible and for the highest price. There are cases when this is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;problem, and the units under construction are snapped up&nbsp;like hotcakes, and there are opposite cases when developers need to&nbsp;connect more partner sales and promote lagging properties among buyers&mdash;and this still needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;managed depending on&nbsp;demand.

            Design Limitations
        </h2>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The business model chosen by&nbsp;Property Finder&rsquo;s stakeholders imposes constraints that the B2B design department must consider in&nbsp;their work.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            <b> Property Finder only works with B2B professionals regarding listing placements. </b>
            That means if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;post a&nbsp;listing, you must be&nbsp;a&nbsp;brokerage, register in&nbsp;the system, and pass compliance checks. A&nbsp;private individual, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;property owner, cannot create their own advertisement for selling their apartment. This differentiates the platform from many other real estate classifieds. This model was chosen not by&nbsp;chance; firstly, its purpose was to&nbsp;minimize the incidence of&nbsp;fraud and false advertisements on&nbsp;the platform. Secondly, such requirements are mandated by&nbsp;UAE laws, where a&nbsp;property owner must work through a&nbsp;realtor when selling property&mdash;however, the company&rsquo;s model also operates in&nbsp;Egypt, where there are no&nbsp;similar legislative requirements (and it&nbsp;has its niche, with fewer listings but considered more trustworthy).
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The second limitation relates to&nbsp;financial policy. 
            <b> Placing listings on&nbsp;the classified operates on&nbsp;a&nbsp;subscription basis, where the brokerage must pay a&nbsp;certain amount in&nbsp;dirhams each month, and for this, they get internal currency called "credits". </b>
            Credits are spent on&nbsp;listing placements. Unused credits expire at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;each month. This model resembles paying for a&nbsp;mobile phone or&nbsp;internet service&mdash;you pay a&nbsp;fixed amount per month for a&nbsp;package of&nbsp;services, which includes a&nbsp;certain number of&nbsp;minutes and gigabytes; anything you don&rsquo;t use expires at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the following month. This limitation is&nbsp;more controversial, as&nbsp;the real estate market is&nbsp;cyclical; in&nbsp;some months, you may need more credits for publications, in&nbsp;others, less, and if&nbsp;they expire, it&nbsp;becomes harder to&nbsp;plan work, and you may feel frustrated by&nbsp;the wasted funds. Also, the inconvenience of&nbsp;this model is&nbsp;that, for a&nbsp;rough understanding of&nbsp;ROI and planning a&nbsp;marketing budget, brokerages often need to&nbsp;convert dirhams into credits and back. This model is&nbsp;because Property Finder wants to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;stable and maximally high revenue stream.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that this model is&nbsp;strict; it&nbsp;has evolved over the years, and many things are tied to&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;can only, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;designer, highlight its disadvantages for the brokerage and advantages for the Property Finder, but not decide whether to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;should consider it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;work to&nbsp;smooth out its inconveniences as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible or&nbsp;even turn them into advantages, for example, by&nbsp;helping to&nbsp;utilize maximum credits in&nbsp;a&nbsp;month with high ROI to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;win-win situation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="reg-36 demi margin-top-88 margin-bottom-16"> 
            PF Expert
        </h2>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            PF&nbsp;Expert is&nbsp;a&nbsp;service for B2B clients from Property Finder. This service has its own branding, which uses blue-violet as&nbsp;the primary color, and its website design differs from a&nbsp;similar site for individual consumers. This situation is&nbsp;partly because the company wanted to&nbsp;separate branding for individuals from professionals and partly due to&nbsp;legacy&mdash;once PF&nbsp;Expert began to&nbsp;be&nbsp;made on&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;Backbone&nbsp;JS, it&nbsp;used components something similar to&nbsp;Material Design different from B2C&nbsp;style. Now, we&nbsp;are smoothly converting it&nbsp;to&nbsp;React Native components, simultaneously developing a&nbsp;new service design for a&nbsp;smooth transition, matching as&nbsp;many components as&nbsp;possible while maintaining different branding for B2B and B2C (that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;business requirement).

However, since there is&nbsp;less B2B communication design, we&nbsp;mostly use blue-violet color as&nbsp;the main color.

            Roles in B2B Brokerage
        </h2>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            A&nbsp;common brokerage model in&nbsp;the UAE consists of&nbsp;three main roles.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            <b> The Manager </b>
            (Decision Maker) decides on&nbsp;investing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new source of&nbsp;leads, signs documents, wants to&nbsp;see the results of&nbsp;their agents&rsquo; work, the payback of&nbsp;the service, and useful insights into the real estate market.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            <b> The Agent </b> 
            works in&nbsp;the field. They meet with buyers and sellers, photograph and show apartments, negotiate, and close deals.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            <b> The Admin </b>
            is&nbsp;an&nbsp;office employee who receives photos and other terms from the agents, based on&nbsp;which they create, publish, and monitor listings. They also compile sales funnel reports for the management.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Agent—Admin interaction is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;labor division in&nbsp;local brokerages, which partly developed because&nbsp;a) someone in&nbsp;authority needs to&nbsp;decide which listings are worth costly promotions, and this is&nbsp;better done by&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who sees the full picture of&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;ads across all agents, b) agents have limited opportunities to&nbsp;publish and verify their listing on&nbsp;the&nbsp;go. In&nbsp;any case, this does not mean that such interaction is&nbsp;always present; in&nbsp;small companies, agents perform the admin role and need a&nbsp;tool for convenient on-the-go listing management.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;mention that, depending on&nbsp;the brokerage model, there are also additional roles. For example, several managers might be&nbsp;at&nbsp;different hierarchical levels. One might be&nbsp;authorized to&nbsp;sign the contracts and pay for the service, and the other might not. An&nbsp;agent coach might need to&nbsp;see the leaderboard but does not allocate possible credits for use among agents. Somewhere, a&nbsp;finance person needs to&nbsp;account for written-off funds as&nbsp;a&nbsp;company asset and have access to&nbsp;this information, and so&nbsp;on.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            It&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;role model that would satisfy the needs of&nbsp;all types of&nbsp;businesses maximally so&nbsp;that every brokerage, both large with many offices and small with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;agents, would find the system convenient to&nbsp;use without unnecessary or&nbsp;especially complex settings.

            One of&nbsp;the tasks of&nbsp;design is&nbsp;the correct use of&nbsp;information for decision-making. We&nbsp;conduct searches and identify the set of&nbsp;data that needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;measured to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;complete picture of&nbsp;the customer experience and to&nbsp;make informed decisions: determining the direction of&nbsp;development, prioritizing, creating new features, and evaluating the achievement of&nbsp;set goals. This is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;trivial task&mdash;it involves using a&nbsp;large pool of&nbsp;information correctly to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;comprehensive understanding of&nbsp;the customer experience and how it&nbsp;reflects in&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s final results.

For example, we&nbsp;first monitor tickets created by&nbsp;account managers, which highlight the most painful issues that sometimes concern not only the technical side of&nbsp;the service but also problems with user experience. Then we&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;research that confirms or&nbsp;refutes hypotheses about product development. We&nbsp;also consider information obtained from surveys, feedback forms, comments from the App Store and Google Market, and comprehensive analysis of&nbsp;user behavior within the service.

            Setting Objectives and Measuring Outcomes
        </h2>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;each quarter, every designer from the B2B department sets upcoming goals, about seventy percent of&nbsp;which are team goals and thirty percent are personal. Team goals depend on&nbsp;the team&rsquo;s objectives, i.e., what they need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop the product within their area of&nbsp;responsibility, while personal goals are related to&nbsp;their development as&nbsp;professionals or&nbsp;their contributions to&nbsp;the company that is&nbsp;not linked to&nbsp;the internal hierarchy. Typically, team goals involve designing new pages or&nbsp;features, while personal goals include taking courses, speaking at&nbsp;conferences, and developing the design system.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The product designer&rsquo;s role in&nbsp;the company is&nbsp;strong. We&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;strategic sessions with product owners, managers, and analysts to&nbsp;determine service development priorities according to&nbsp;the leadership&rsquo;s vision and requirements, legislative updates, the current or&nbsp;projected market situation, and collected feedback. The general scheme for setting goals is&nbsp;as&nbsp;follows: during the strategic session, teams define quarterly priorities based on&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s high-level positioning, from which we&nbsp;derive clear and straightforward product design goals.

            Each goal contains metrics by&nbsp;which its achievement is&nbsp;assessed. And sometimes, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;starting point from which to&nbsp;measure behavioral stats. For example, when we&nbsp;did not have an&nbsp;introductory onboarding process, it&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;say how many steps were skipped or&nbsp;completed before its implementation&mdash;but it&nbsp;was possible to&nbsp;determine metric: the time from registering the first user to&nbsp;creating the first listing should be&nbsp;reduced. Also, sometimes, it&rsquo;s difficult to&nbsp;determine the success of&nbsp;a&nbsp;decision based solely on&nbsp;web analytics. For instance, in&nbsp;the new block with the status of&nbsp;obtaining superagent (it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;benefit for the broker) where just a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;sessions and time spent on&nbsp;the page will not allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;understand how much it&nbsp;has become more valuable and clear&mdash;such cases require the collection of&nbsp;feedback. However, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, there are metrics that are quite accurate; for example, when designing agent-client interactions, the goal was to&nbsp;reduce negative reviews on&nbsp;unavailable properties in&nbsp;listings, and the number of&nbsp;such reviews was the metric.

            The design process in&nbsp;the team is&nbsp;structured as&nbsp;follows:
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            Each designer in&nbsp;the team is&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior specialist, meaning they can work independently. Therefore, after a&nbsp;task is&nbsp;defined, each designer decides what they need to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;it, which could be&nbsp;initial research, consultations with all stakeholders, or&nbsp;perhaps the preliminary information is&nbsp;sufficient, and they are ready to&nbsp;begin designing scenarios and interfaces. I&nbsp;should note that situations vary, so&nbsp;sometimes designers consult with me&nbsp;or&nbsp;colleagues to&nbsp;decide the most effective work sequence; other times, they need my&nbsp;assistance to&nbsp;defend the correct assessment of&nbsp;labor costs and work stages to&nbsp;product owners, who are always in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush and tend to&nbsp;want designs without proper elaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            After the designer completes the final design, which may happen after several iterations of&nbsp;research and discussions with the product team, they send a&nbsp;link to&nbsp;this design with a&nbsp;brief description in&nbsp;our Slack channel. As&nbsp;the team is&nbsp;small, every member must find time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete review of&nbsp;their colleague&rsquo;s project in&nbsp;Figma, evaluate scenarios, the accuracy of&nbsp;breakpoints and templates, the usability of&nbsp;components, overall consistency, and so&nbsp;on. Once the project passes our internal review, the designer can move forward, prepare keys for localizing the design, make versions for other countries, and convey the layouts to&nbsp;the developers.

        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-36 margin-bottom-16">
            After the layouts are handed over to&nbsp;development, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;design review step on&nbsp;the test stand, where the designer checks how well the engineers&rsquo; work matches what they envisioned. Sometimes, compromises are made when minor flaws might be&nbsp;overlooked due to&nbsp;tight deadlines, but I&nbsp;do not encourage this, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;usually strive for perfect execution.

        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            The designer&rsquo;s work does not end there; after the design comes to&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the product, they must keep their finger on&nbsp;the pulse and check how seamless the user&rsquo;s journey remains with the new functionality. They must also gather information about the applicability and value of&nbsp;the outcome of&nbsp;their work.

            Arabic translation, adaptation in different countries
        </h3>
        <p class="reg-22 li-he-30 margin-top-16 margin-bottom-16">
            One of&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s requirements for the product is&nbsp;its high-quality translation into Arabic and its proper adaptation in&nbsp;other countries of&nbsp;presence: Egypt, KSA, Qatar, and Bahrain. For this purpose, we&nbsp;use Localise, which creates a&nbsp;library of&nbsp;keys in&nbsp;two languages, and our engineers, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;pulling the necessary language keys, also change the direction of&nbsp;the content. Each page or&nbsp;project has a&nbsp;unique template for naming keys, following the rule &quot;ProjectName_UniqueKeyName.&quot; The translation of&nbsp;these keys is&nbsp;done manually by&nbsp;the content team. This approach is&nbsp;not perfect; sometimes, in&nbsp;recordings, I&nbsp;see how a&nbsp;key in&nbsp;the Arabic version did not pull through or&nbsp;was not added, or&nbsp;I encounter issues with the direction for proper names or&nbsp;numbers, which we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not translate and leave in&nbsp;English execution. However, according to&nbsp;our colleagues from Egypt, this approach is&nbsp;much better than just automatic translation.

            In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;creating keys and verifying their correct display in&nbsp;testing and production, the designer, in&nbsp;many cases, must prepare adapted versions of&nbsp;the interface for different countries. Initially, any design is&nbsp;made for our main market, the UAE, and once its final version passes the internal design review, the designer prepares layouts for other countries. Usually, this is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;complicated task, but it&nbsp;requires attention to&nbsp;detail. Since other countries have less functionality, for example, there are no&nbsp;compliance checks specific to&nbsp;Dubai, no&nbsp;verification of&nbsp;listings, consumer ratings, etc., the designer simply removes the relevant blocks or&nbsp;changes some fields of&nbsp;forms or&nbsp;widgets. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;already mentioned, the main difficulty here lies in&nbsp;meticulousness: it&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;carefully collect interface requirements for different countries from the product owner and present them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple form in&nbsp;Figma so&nbsp;that developers understand the differences, which should not deviate from the description tasks in&nbsp;Jira.
